-> THe simulator starts a bunch of nodes each with a set amount of buddies.
    Use the algorithm to change the node's presence.
        when offline -> update server as offline.
            server notifies buddy of offline status
                if server sees buddy as offline don't send a message.
        if online -> update server as online.
            get statuses of buddies.
                request buddy statuses.
            server notifies buddy of online status

Node
    -> carries its state
    -> carries its buddies

Control
    -> carries all nodes states


Data Structure

{Client, Status, Buddies}


update state to onnline X
    - Control pings client as online
        Client changes state to online
        Control changes state of Node to online.
    - Client pings Control to update buddies
        - Control pings buddies with the new statuses

update state to offline
    - Control takes node as offline.
    - Control pings buddies to notify as offline.




% Done: Start the nodes returning pids for each node which has been started.
% Done: Start the control center for routing info.
% Done: For each of the nodes notify it of the Control.
    % Done: The Node should send the buddies. The Control should keep a dictionary of (buddy) -> clients.
% start Pids of nodes to send/receive messages.



control calls itself and does state_update on server
    server calls client->state_update
